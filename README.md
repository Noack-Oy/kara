**Kara is NOT SUPPORTED**

## Kara Web Framework

Kara is a web framework for the JVM written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/). It enables developers to build succinct, type-safe HTML and CSS all in one language.

The article [*Type-safe Web with Kotlin*](http://jaxenter.com/type-safe-web-with-kotlin-106187.html) by Andrey Breslav  illustrates the benefits of such a framework.

## Authors

The project originated with Tiny Mission, a compact web and mobile development firm that sought to leverage Kara to accelerate work and enhance coding quality.

Subsequently, it was taken up for active development and later discontinued by JetBrains, the creators of Kotlin.

## License

Kara is Open Source and licensed under the Apache Licenses, version 2.0. It can be freely used in commercial projects.

## Run the sample

Download the repository, load the project in IntelliJ IDEA (can take a while), then choose the "Sample Server" configuration in the toolbar and run it.

You can now open the sample web page at `http://localhost:3000`.
